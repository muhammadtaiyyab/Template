		  <h2>Target Archery Disciplines</h2>
		  <div>
		  	<!-- This paragraph describes the different types of archery offered at Bendigo Target Archery Club -->
		    <p>Bendigo Target Archery Club offers Target, Indoor, and Clout  archery. Target, Indoor and Clout competitions are regularly hosted on our facilities.</p>
		    <!-- The sub-heading provides information about Target archery -->
		    <h3>Target</h3>
		    <!-- This paragraph provides detailed information about Target archery, including the scoring system and number of arrows per 'end' -->
		    <p>Target archery involves shooting at a target butt centred approximately 1.5m above ground level which will have scoring circles of up to 122cm in diameter on the target face. The target face has concentric circles and scoring starts in the centre with the smallest circle – the bulls eye – recorded as an X which equals 10 points. The next larger circle also equals 10, then 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 and then M for miss. Some target faces only have X through to 6 scoring rings. There are also a few smaller target faces where the circles are closer together. Archers usually shoot 3 or 6 arrows per ‘end’.</p>

		    <!-- This paragraph provides information about the number of target lanes and archers the club can accommodate -->
		    <p>The club accommodates approximately 50 target lanes or 150 archers shooting simultaneously, with target distances up to 90 metres.</p>
		    <!-- This is the heading for the Indoor Archery Discipline section -->
		    <h3>Indoor</h3>
		    <!-- This paragraph describes the specifics of Indoor Archery, including the target face, scoring rings, distance of shooting, and use of electronic timing system -->
		    <p>Indoor archery has smaller scoring faces than target archery and archers shoot 3 arrows per end at 18m or 25m distances. The target faces are fixed to a vertical wall centred approximately 1.2m to 1.7m above the floor. 18m distances use a 40cm diameter with X/10 through to 1 scoring rings or a ‘three spot’, which shows three separate target circles with scoring circles from X/10 to the 6 ring. The ‘three spot’ requires the archer to shoot one arrow into each of the three circles.</p>
		    <p>The indoor shed holds 15 18m indoor target lanes. Most of the lanes also allow 25m shooting distances. The club uses an electronic timing system in the indoor halls.</p>
		    <!-- This section describes the Clout discipline in archery -->
		    <h3>Clout</h3>
		    <p>The target face in clout is 15 metres across and is flat on the ground! Each scoring circle on the target is about 75cm wide and is bordered by a coloured flag identifying the standard 10 ring scoring circles. The ‘bulls eye’ in the centre of the target face is a marker post which is called the Clout. Archers shoot six arrows per end, aiming up into the air to about a 45 degree angle so their arrows travel in a large parabola.</p>
		    <p>Clout is shot at distances from 100m to 180m depending on the archer’s age and bow division.</p>
		    <p>See the official Archery Australia Clout Rounds: <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CUOIAsFJ7qqm5HTRr6f1xHBRFbxlhOF7/view?usp=share_link">AA-CloutRounds.pdf</a></p>

			    <li>Level 1, Archery Instructors – there are about 20 active Archery Instructors at the club.</li>
			    <li>Level 2, Coaches (level 2) –  Jenny,  Melissa, David, and Adrian.</li>
			    <li>Level 3, Club and Regional Coach – Shelley.</li>
			  </ul>
			  <!-- Paragraph describing how to identify Level 2 and 3 Coaches -->
			  <p>The Level 2 and 3 Coaches can be identified by the shirts they wear. They look a little different to most members’ shirts to make it easier to spot them around the club. They have bright gold sleeves with “coach” written on the back and their first name on the front. Whilst always busy helping people, they are also very approachable.</p>
			  <!-- Paragraph describing basic coaching help available on Saturday mornings -->
			  <p>Basic coaching help is available to all archers on most Saturday mornings from 9.00 to 11.30. The Level 2 and 3 Coaches offer assistance with measuring and advising you on your first bow purchase and the setup of your new bow. More experienced archers may make arrangements for coaching by seeing the Club Coach.</p>
			  <!-- Paragraph reminding members to respect coaches' time -->
			  <p>Coaches and instructors deserve some time themselves to shoot so please respect their time in the afternoon.</p>
			  <!-- Paragraph describing general workshops/seminars held each month -->
			  <p>General workshop/seminar sessions are held each month for all members, with topics like ‘Bow Set Up and Tuning”, ‘Purchasing the correct Arrows’, ‘Arrow Fletching and Maintenance’, etc.</p>

			  <h2>Purchasing your first bow</h2>
			  <!-- The first paragraph provides advice to new members about hiring equipment before purchasing a bow. -->
			  <p>New members are encouraged not to go out and buy a bow until you have spoken to a coach. It is recommended that you hire equipment for the first two months and then see a coach to get measured and to discuss the options.</p>
			  <!-- The second paragraph provides information about getting help with setting up a new bow from a coach. -->
			  <p>When you do have a new bow, book in advance with a coach to obtain help with setting it up for the first time. This can be done on most Saturday mornings, however the time for this is 09.00 sharp. Booking via email is preferred.</p>
			  <!-- The third paragraph highlights the importance of matching arrows to the bow and archer's draw length. -->

		<section class="coach">
			<div>
			  <!-- Heading for the section -->
			  <h2>Aiming</h2>
			  <!-- Paragraph providing information about where the arrow goes when released. -->
			  <p>Arrows go where the bow is pointing at the time of release and during the time it takes for the arrow travel to clear the bow.</p>
			  <!-- Paragraph providing information about using back and front sights to aim. -->
			  <p>To point the bow in the right place we use a back sight and a front sight, unless you are just using your judgement to guess where the bow is pointed. The back sight must be aligned with the front sight and straight at the gold at the instant of release. We must use all our training and practice of skills to keep the bow stable at the instant of release and until the arrow has cleared the bow.</p>
			  <!-- Paragraph providing information about the back and front sights on a bow. -->
			  <p>The back sight on a bow is the string. The front sight is the circle, pin or dot on the sight, or for bare bow archers, the tip of the arrow.</p>
			  <!-- Paragraph providing information about aiming and focusing the eye's vision. -->
			  <p>To aim, only focus the eye’s vision on the gold on the target face. Focus with determination. The front sight (circle or dot) should drift down to the gold as part of the shooting process, but do not adjust the eye’s focus onto the circle/dot. Let the brain naturally centre the circle on the gold. Ensure the back sight (the string) is aligned on the side of the bow’s riser “cut out” or through the side of the circle of the sight (for a recurver). For compounders using a peep in the string the concept is exactly the same.</p>
			  <!-- Paragraph providing information about checking the string is vertical to avoid left and right arrows. -->
			  <p>Check that the string is vertical as bow cant (tilting) variation will cause left and right arrows; to do this if you are a recurver use the side of the target face as a vertical reference, or for a compounder use your bubble. Expand through the clicker (if you are using a clicker) and release the arrow.</p>
			  <!-- Paragraph providing information about the importance of repetitive precision in archery. -->
			  <p>Skills acquisition requires determined effort. Archery is the art of repetitive precision. In time, the more natural and subconscious the process the better. The arrow goes where the bow is pointed at the instance of release and clearing of the bow.</p>

		<section class="coach">
			<div>
			  <!-- Heading for the section. -->
			  <h2>Core Stability</h2>
			  <!-- Paragraph discussing the significance of core stability in archery. -->
			  <p>Why are coaches so concerned with core strength and stability?</p>
			  <p>The most important technique or factor in scoring well in archery is Core Stability — that is, holding a fully-drawn bow without any wobble. Without a solid core, an archer will need to be very lucky to get a good score. The core is the foundation of the shot – without a solid core there is little an archer can consistently do to overcome instability. The core is said to be over 80% of the shot and all technique needs to be built on top of a solid foundation.</p>
			  <!-- Paragraph showing the effect of wobbling on aiming accuracy. -->
			  <p>An archer shooting at 50 metres onto the large 122cm target aiming at the cntre oif the target but has a 9mm wobble (the movement of the bow) will miss the gold by over 20cm. This shows how important core stability is in archery.</p>
			  <!-- Paragraph suggesting exercises to improve core stability. -->
		      <p>Core stability can be improved through exercises such as planks, side planks, and bird dogs. It is also important to work on posture and balance. A strong core will not only improve your archery skills but also help prevent injury.</p>
